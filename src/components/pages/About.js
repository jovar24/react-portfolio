          I enjoy solving problems and working with algorithms, I enjoy learning
          new techniques and strategies. I also have the logic and structure of
          coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code. I
          continuously expand my network and knowledge by attending meetups and
          researching and working on projects as well.
